**Christ the King**

*—In Christianity, Jesus is referred to as "Christ the King" and is associated with the idea of the Kingdom of God, where Christ is said to be seated at God's right hand.*

**Mary and Martha**

*—To seek God's presence and to listen well as He speaks to us is one of the important lessons that the story of Mary and Martha taught us.*

**St. Jude Thaddeus**

*—St. Jude Thaddeus is the Patron Saint of Hope and impossible causes and one of Jesus' original twelve Apostles. He is also the patron saint of my parish.*

**Thankful Leper**

*—One of the most profound stories found in the gospels. We can learn that God values the least, He honors faith, and He cherishes gratitude.*

**Watchful Servant**

*—The message of this parable of the watchful servants is very clear: be ready for Jesus' return because he will come when it is least expected.*

`Some Wise Words`
>Artistic talent is a gift from God and whoever discovers it in himself has a certain obligation: to know that he cannot waste this talent, but must develop it.
